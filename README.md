# Wellness-Based Healthcare Cost Prediction with Functional Risk Profiling

This project investigates how lifestyle and demographic factors influence healthcare costs, with a focus on early risk detection and preventive insights.

An occupational therapy (OT) perspective is incorporated to translate wellness-related risk factors into functional and rehabilitation risk profiles relevant to health insurers.


## Problem Statement
Health insurance providers aim not only to predict medical costs, but to identify individuals at risl of future high healthcare expenditure and functional decline as early as possible. 

This project explores wheather wellness and demograpic indicators can be used to:
- Predict healthcare costs
- Flag individuals at risk of complex rehabilitation needs
- Support preventive, function-focused interventions that reduce long term claims

## Objectives
- Predict individual healthcare costs using lifestyle and demographic data
- Identify key behavioural and wellness-related cost drivers
- Detect high-risk individuals early using a functional risk framework
- Develop an OT-informed rehabilitation complexity score
- Explore preventive strategies that could reduce future healthcare costs and loss of independence

## Dataset
The dataset includes demographic and lifestyle variables such as: 
- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Smoking status
- Region
(Dataset source to be added)

## Approach
- Exploratoy Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Regression-based cost prediction models
- High-cost risk classification
- OT-informed functional risk scoring
- Model interpretation and feature importance analysis

## Clinical & Functional Interpretation(OT Perspective)
Model outputs will be interpreted though and occupational therapy lens, focusing on:
- Functional capacity and independence
- Barriers to recovery and return-to-work
- Modifiable rehabilitation outcomes
- Preventive interventions aligned with OT practice

##Tool
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
